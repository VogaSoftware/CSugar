CSugar
==
Keep a computer awake but in a new way, unlike allready impressive applications like Caffeine.

## Modes
CSugar has two modes and an OFF button.

### Do not sleep
Sends a command to the system that breifly changes how much space is needed to keep the mouse awake, in this case being less than most GPUs can even render into view (arround ~0.00000001 of a millimeter)
### Do not suspend
Sends a command to the system that halts demoting the computer's task to freeze the code activity of a program. This can allow to run tasks with the screen in the off mode.

## Distributions
The below is a key for witch version to choose. There will be different versions of the app for different people.

### Node, Electron and Binary in Package (Windows)
An exe file with a node.dll file, all of electronJS and comes in a little exe file. 100%  independent

### Electron and Binary in Package (Windows)
Comes in an exe file, has the electronJS library in it but you have to have nodejs for it. Depends on external node.js

### Source-code in package (Windows)
Compiles and runs on the spot every launch. Lightest version, requires external resources.

### Un-neatened binary (Windows, Mac?, Lunix)
Literally just what electron-packager made because I don't know how to neat up mac and lunix packages, sorry.

## APIs
This application uses the Voga SNAP Framework, Voga Archatex framework and the Voga Shared Resource Pipeline.
Also NodeJS, Electron and another API that can be found in the credits.md file.
